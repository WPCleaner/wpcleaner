# DO NOT MODIFY THIS SCRIPT, IT IS OVERWRITTEN ON EACH EXECUTION BY GETDOWN
#
# You can execute this script with optional parameters that will be passed to
# WPCleaner. For example, if you want to automatically login to English
# Wikipedia, you can use the following syntax:
#   WPCleaner.sh en <username> <password>
#
# Or with a credentials.txt file containing these 2 lines,
#   user=<username>
#   password=<password>
# you can use the following syntax to login automatically:
#   WPCleaner.sh -credentials credentials.txt en
#
# If you want to pass extra arguments to the JVM, like increasing the memory
# available to Java, create a file named 'extra.txt' in the same directory as
# this script, with read permissions for any user which might invoke it, with
# one parameter per line. For example, to allow 8G of RAM, the line would read:
#   -Xmx=8192M
